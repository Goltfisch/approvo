## What is approvo?

Approvo is a small webapp to manage requests for stuff that needs to be bought. 

Example: Your mouse is old and laggy. You would love to get a new one. Just create a new request, so that the admin can approve the costs and the purchasing department gets notified and order the new shiny mouse.

To have a good overview and evaluate the data later, we have written that small piece of software.

The main goal was to learn reactjs in combination with meteorjs and having some fun writing code.
